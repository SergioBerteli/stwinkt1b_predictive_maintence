@par Application Description 

Serial_DataLog application has two major features: sensor raw data streaming via USB
(Virtual COM Port class) and sensor data storage on SD card.
If USB is selected, the flowing data can be read using a generic application
like TeraTerm/Putty or any other.
If SD Card is selected, the data stream is logged to a csv file (Comma Separated Values).
After the application is started:
- the user can view/record data from the on-board environmental sensors like Temperature, 
Humidity (if available) and Pressure.
- the user can view/record data from the on-board MEMS sensors like Accelerometer,
Gyroscope and Magnetometer.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This application runs on STWIN platform available in STEVAL-STWINKT1.
  - STM32 Virtual COM Port Driver for Windows can be downloaded from st.com - STSW-STM32102
    
@par How to use it? 

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs viz. IAR, µVision and STM32CubeIDE. In order to make
the program work, you must do the following:
 - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
   installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
   after building.

For IAR:
 - Open IAR toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with
   Embedded Workbench V8.50.5).
 - Open the IAR project file EWARM\Project.eww
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For µVision:
 - Open µVision 5 toolchain (this firmware has been successfully tested with MDK-ARM Professional 
   Version: 5.30).
 - Open the µVision project file MDK-ARM\Project.uvprojx
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.

For STM32CubeIDE:
 - Open STM32CubeIDE (this firmware has been successfully tested with STM32CubeIDE v1.4.2).
 - Set the default workspace proposed by the IDE (please be sure that there are not spaces in the
   workspace path).
 - Press "File" -> "Import" -> "Existing Projects into Workspace"; press "Browse" in the "Select 
   root directory" and choose the path where the project is located
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
 - Run the example.
